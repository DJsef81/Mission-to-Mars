# Mission-to-Mars
Module 10

# Purpose of Analysis

Robin wants to gather all the information about the Mission to Mars from all over the web, and display it in a central location, without spending all of her free time gathering it manually. 

To do this she wanted to build a web application that will scrape new data and add collect it with a push of a button. 

Before she could do this she needed to 
understand how websites are built 
to write a python script that can navigate the webpages to collect the right information. 

She needs a place to store the information, 
a noSQL database, MongoDB - because internet data is "messy" 

To put all that together in a web application of her own, she'll need to use 
Flask, a web framework, that allows her to create the web app with python, then customize it with HTML and CSS

Create a portfolio to showcase her projects, including this one. 
Use Bootstrap
